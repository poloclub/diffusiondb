## Composition

*Dataset creators should read through the questions in this section prior to any data collection and then provide answers once collection is complete. Most of these questions are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.*

1. **What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g. documents, photos, people, countries)?** Are there multiple types of instances (e.g. movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.

	*Your Answer Here*

2. **How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?**

	*Your Answer Here*

3. **Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?** If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g. geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g. to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).

	*Your Answer Here*

4. **What data does each instance consist of?** "Raw" data (e.g. unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.

	*Your Answer Here*

5. **Is there a label or target associated with each instance?** If so, please provide a description.

	*Your Answer Here*

6. **Is any information missing from individual instances?** If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g. because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g. redacted text.

	*Your Answer Here*

7. **Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g. users' movie ratings, social network links)?** If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.

	*Your Answer Here*

8. **Are there recommended data splits (e.g. training, development/validation, testing)?** If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.

	*Your Answer Here*

9. **Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?** If so, please provide a description.

	*Your Answer Here*

10. **Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g. websites, tweets, other datasets)?** If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g. licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.

	*Your Answer Here*

11. **Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g. data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)?** If so, please provide a description.

## Collection

*As with the previous section, dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any data collection to flag potential issues and then provide answers once collection is complete. In addition to the goals of the prior section, the answers to questions here may provide information that allow others to reconstruct the dataset without access to it.*

1. **How was the data associated with each instance acquired?** Was the data directly observable (e.g. raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g. survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g. part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.

	*Your Answer Here*

2. **What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g. hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)?** How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?

## Preprocessing / Cleaning / Labeling

*Dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any pre-processing, cleaning, or labeling and then provide answers once these tasks are complete. The questions in this section are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks. For example, text that has been converted into a “bag-of-words” is not suitable for tasks involving word order.*

1. **Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g. discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)?** If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this section.

	*Your Answer Here*

2. **Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g. to support unanticipated future uses)?** If so, please provide a link or other access point to the "raw" data.

	*Your Answer Here*

3. **Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available?** If so, please provide a link or other access point.

	*Your Answer Here*

4. **Any other comments?**
